"""Companies mode (TASK-CHAMPION T5): a company states its need in one sentence and gets, in one call, a Ready brief, a
private demand check and an opened milestone. Anyone anywhere answers an open milestone and is paid only on the proof
Knos chose for the field, after the 72-hour challenge window; each verified result becomes an attestation on the solver
(knos_wanted.track), so the next company sees proven solvers first.

    need(sentence, user, open_, state)   POST /api/company/need (signed in: company SSO, or any Knos session)
    solvers()                            GET /api/solvers: wallets by verified milestones, each read back from devnet

The proof per field (Knos chooses, the company does not fill a form):
  software       signed CI: the named test passes in the repository's GitHub Actions (a machine check)
  data / models  a reproducible run: the pipeline re-run from a fresh checkout gives the reported metric
  wet lab        the lab protocol and a QC attestation (SAS) by the lab that ran it
  hardware       a signed test report from an independent test lab
