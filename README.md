**The neutral meter for AI agent work: neither side keeps the count.**

Pay AI agents only when your checks pass.

For teams that pay AI coding agents on GitHub: a program holds the pay until your checks pass.

Of 241 merged agent pull requests claiming passing tests, 9 failed a test, build, lint or type check.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    task["You post a task, your rules for done, and the money"]
    work["An AI agent or a person does the work"]
    checks["GitHub runs your checks"]
    paid["The worker is paid automatically, once you merge the work"]
    back["Nobody is paid. At the deadline, the money comes back to you"]
    task --> work --> checks
    checks -->|pass| paid
    checks -->|fail| back
```

*You set the rules first. The money moves only when the work passes them.*

1. One comment on an issue (a task's page on GitHub) posts the task, your checks and the pay: `/knos fund 20 checks: test`.
2. An [AI agent](docs/WORDS.md#ai-agent) or a person sends the work as a [pull request](docs/WORDS.md#pull-request).
3. When the [checks](docs/WORDS.md#checks-ci) pass and you [merge](docs/WORDS.md#merge) the work, a program pays the worker.

**Ready to try it on your own repository?** [Get started in five minutes](docs/START.md).

## Try it in ten seconds

Open [the check](https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/check/) in your browser. Paste the link to an AI agent's pull request. It tells you whether the agent's checks really passed.

No pull request at hand? On [the front page](https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/), press **Try a sample invoice**. It checks a made-up bill from an AI agent.

There is nothing to install, no sign-up, and nothing is sent to Knos.

## Why nobody can fudge the count

GitHub (where your code lives) [signs](docs/WORDS.md#signed) a [token](docs/WORDS.md#token-oidc) for each run of your checks. The token proves which workflow ran, on which commit. Nobody else can make it.

A workflow is the script that runs your checks. A commit is one saved version of the code.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    money["The money waits on Solana, not with Knos"]
    run["GitHub runs your checks and signs what ran"]
    copies["You and they each keep a copy"]
    bill["Both copies give the same bill"]
    pay["A program checks the signature, then pays"]
    money --> run
    run --> copies --> bill
    run --> pay
```

*GitHub signs which workflow ran, on which commit. Both sides rebuild the same bill, and a program pays.*

You and the other side each keep a copy of those signed runs. Each side rebuilds the bill from its own copy (the command is `knos meter reconcile`).

**The two bills match line for line, so neither side can change the count alone.**

The money waits in a program on [Solana](docs/WORDS.md#solana), not with Knos. That program checks GitHub's signature before it pays. Today one person can still change that program, after a public wait ([who holds the keys](docs/TRUST.md)).

Today Knos earns its fee only when work is accepted. When you get a refund, the fee goes back to you. So Knos gains when work passes, and the meter is not yet fully neutral ([the plan to fix it](docs/reference/CHARTER.md)).

Why Solana: Money is released with no custodian, and neither buyer nor supplier can change the count. One person holds every upgrade key today; a program change waits 48 hours in public. A custodian is a company that holds your money for you.

## Is it real?

It runs on test money only: [test USDC](docs/WORDS.md#test-usdc) on Solana's practice network, [devnet](docs/WORDS.md#devnet).

There are no customers yet. Nobody has bought anything ([what is not real yet](docs/reference/DISCLOSURE.md)).

One person holds every key today. Any change to the programs waits in public for 48 hours first ([who holds the keys](docs/TRUST.md)).

## Check every claim yourself

Start at [the release page](docs/reference/MANIFEST.md): the code, how it is built, what runs on devnet, the payments and the fees.

One task from start to end, on 9 Oct 2026 with Knos 0.3.23, in a repository Knos owns, with test USDC (one step fixed by hand): [funded](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3UaY22WKexigMpkVhibfeMdNgBiyybWm2Z4LuLskKGbNUDXV34yYWyH42atxFjELbrqSgoVs6TwpFzSQwhfXqzgM?cluster=devnet) · [wrong work refused](https://github.com/drexthealpha/knos-witness/actions/runs/37890511112/job/113690226126) · [paid](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/2PtmKUrQHKPARZE4nr35Te559NGQSG7tSHUfwzcKCAjL7gzvQ76fNTVLMWvq8mcZLxd27tbyTe31mCk2PxEGfAqa?cluster=devnet) · [replay paid nothing more](https://github.com/drexthealpha/knos-witness/pull/10#issuecomment-6075196710) · [the record](https://github.com/drexthealpha/knos-witness/blob/acaa854d241c2e030f521b6f5603c8f43c93bab6/witness.json).

Every other claim is one click from [docs/JUDGES.md](docs/JUDGES.md).

## The number

Knos read 241 merged pull requests by AI agents whose description said the tests pass. **In 9 of them, a test, build, lint or type-check job had failed at the last commit** (3.7%; the true share is very likely between 2.0% and 6.9%; [docs/backtest.json](docs/backtest.json)). 19 had a failed check of any kind (7.9%).

A first, automatic scan counted 16 and 30. A person then re-read each one and took out 11 of the 30: they were not merged into the main branch, or the failure or the claim did not hold ([docs/index_review.json](docs/index_review.json), method [version 1](docs/INDEX_METHOD.md), counted by `scripts/backtest.py`).

A second, larger count: in 147 of 826 repositories (17.8%), the first such pull request by an AI agent had a failed check of any kind ([docs/reference/BENCH.md](docs/reference/BENCH.md)). A failed check is GitHub's record, not a judgment of why it failed.

## Words

Pull request, devnet, multisig and more, each in one plain line: [docs/WORDS.md](docs/WORDS.md).

## Questions

### What is Knos?

Knos is the neutral meter for [AI agent](docs/WORDS.md#ai-agent) work. Neither side keeps the count.

### How does Knos pay an AI agent?

You post the task, your [checks](docs/WORDS.md#checks-ci) and the pay before work starts. When the checks pass and you [merge](docs/WORDS.md#merge), a [program](docs/WORDS.md#program) pays the agent.

### Does Knos use real money?

No. It runs on [devnet](docs/WORDS.md#devnet), Solana's practice network, with [test USDC](docs/WORDS.md#test-usdc) worth nothing.

### What does Knos cost?

Checking is free; paying adds 0.30%, at least 0.05 [test USDC](docs/WORDS.md#test-usdc). A tip pays the fee out of the amount instead.

### Who holds the money?

A program on [Solana](docs/WORDS.md#solana) holds it, not Knos. Today one person can change that program, after a public wait.

### Can the buyer refuse to pay?

Not once the checks pass and the work is merged. Before that, the buyer still chooses whether to merge.

### What is a neutral meter?

A count of work that neither side keeps alone. A program checks GitHub's [signature](docs/WORDS.md#signed) of which workflow ran, on which commit.

### How do I try Knos?

Open [the check](https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/check/) and paste an AI agent's pull request. It answers within ten seconds, with no sign-up.

This page names no time for an upgrade, so it stays true before and after one. To see whether a change to the
programs is waiting, done or withdrawn, run `knos status`, or read the site's banner or its
[upgrade record](https://drexthealpha.github.io/Knos/upgrades.json) ([`web/upgrades.json`](web/upgrades.json) is the
copy kept here).

The first set of programs ([`programs`](programs)) has no upgrade authority, so nobody can change it.
It stays as a record, and no new task is funded there.

<!-- capabilities:start -->
**Reproduced by someone else:** none recorded yet. **Exercised on devnet:** `verify_github`, `fund_by_comment`, `fund_from_wallet`, `pay_on_merge` and more, each named in the table. **Deployed on devnet:** `verify_gitlab`, `key_guardian`, `hold_and_bind`. Everything else is tested locally, implemented or not built: [the table with the evidence](docs/reference/CAPABILITIES.md) has one row for each capability, from [`docs/capabilities.json`](docs/capabilities.json). Only runs at the public program ids count here. Each capability's row also notes, with its transaction, any earlier trial run at separate test addresses (Knos 0.3.14).
