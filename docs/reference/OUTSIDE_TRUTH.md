# Outside truth: open signals against 200 past SBIR awards

**In plain words.** We asked Knos's open-signals check about 200 past research awards whose outcome is known. It did no better than a coin: 47.5% right, where always guessing one side gets 50%. We publish it as measured.

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Awards | 200: 100 commercialized, 100 not |
| Accuracy | 47.5% (base rate 50%) |
| Precision / recall | 47.1% / 40.0% |
| p, binomial vs base rate | 0.78 |
| p, Fisher's exact | 0.57 |

- **Population:** Defense Department SBIR/STTR Phase I awards, 2005 to 2014, with an abstract on sbir.gov.
- **Commercialized:** a granted US patent linked to the award's contract (Zenodo, 10.5281/zenodo.17018422). **Not:** no patent and no Phase II on the same topic.
- **What Knos saw:** one phrase, the award's title or the abstract's first sentence. OPEN counts as a prediction of commercialized.
- **Why it can fail:** open signals measure public attention today, not whether a 2010 defense prototype was patented. A patent is invention, not sales.
- **Since:** the refuse list now applies to demand checks, so ideas naming weapons would be refused, not scored.
