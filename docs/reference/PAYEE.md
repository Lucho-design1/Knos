# Collecting a held payout

A merged pull request pays the address bound to its author's GitHub account. With none bound, knos_pay holds the
money for that account, and the reply on the pull request links to `#payee=<login>` on the site (web/payee.js).

## What the page does

1. Reads what is held for the login: held jobs (their amount less the job fee) and held orders (what they have not
   paid yet), found on devnet by the account's numeric GitHub id.
2. Makes a passkey in the browser (WebAuthn, P-256: the same kind of key a phone uses to sign in to a website). Its address is a knos_passkey account: no seed phrase, no
   wallet app. The address is copied. The Get paid page (`#claim`) withdraws from the same address later.
3. Gives one link at a time: GitHub's new-repository form filled in (owner, name `knos-claim`, public, empty) while
   that repository does not exist; then GitHub's new-file page in it with the claim workflow filled in (examples/knos-claim.yml,
   the same file as [`templates/knos-claim`](../../templates/knos-claim)); then the claim workflow's page. No template
   repository is involved since 0.3.31 ([MONOREPO.md](MONOREPO.md)).
4. Check reads the account's Bind on devnet and says whether it names this passkey's address. The relay then sends
   what was held.

The page signs and sends nothing. It reads api.github.com and Solana devnet, only when opened.

## Clicks to a first payout

| | Before (docs, wallet app) | Now (`#payee`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Address | install a wallet app; create a wallet and write down its seed phrase; copy its address (3) | Make a passkey; confirm on the device (2; the address is copied) |
| Repository | open the template; Use this template; Create a new repository; type the name; Create repository (5) | the page's link; Create repository; the page's second link; Commit changes (4) |
| Bind | Actions; knos claim; Run workflow; paste the address; Run workflow (5) | the page's link; Run workflow; paste the address; Run workflow (4) |
| Total | 13 | 10 (4 when the repository exists already) |

Counted on the screens as `web/payee.js` `CLICKS` lists them; tests/web/payee.mjs checks the page shows 13 and 10.
It was 8 while a template repository put the file in; adding the file by its own link costs two clicks and keeps
everything in one repository.

## Why it is not one click

The deployed knos_pay (2.2 since 9 October 2026; the rule is unchanged since Knos 0.3.12) takes a Bind token
only from the pinned claim workflow, in the account's own repository named `knos-claim`, in a run its owner started
by hand (`workflow_dispatch`, first attempt): `programs-v2/knos_pay/src/pay.rs`, `bind`. A push does not count, not
even the commit that adds the workflow file. That is deliberate: GitHub's new-repository form can be
filled in from a link ([query parameters](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)),
so a push could carry an address the link's author chose, made with the owner's click. The address must be the run's
input, pasted by its owner. So the claim workflow keeps `workflow_dispatch` as its only trigger.

A push workflow that starts the claim workflow with `GITHUB_TOKEN` would run (GitHub lets `GITHUB_TOKEN` create
`workflow_dispatch` runs: [triggering a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow)),
but its address would come from the repository, which is the hole above. Knos does not do it.

## What a program change would need (not made)

Fewer clicks safely needs an address that GitHub shows the owner typed, from somewhere a link cannot fill. A comment
on an existing issue is one: GitHub fills a new issue's body from a link but not a comment box. A new knos_pay
instruction could take a bind token from a pinned Knos workflow on `issue_comment` (created, not edited), with
`actor_id` the commenter, carrying `knos2:bind:<address>` from the comment. The payee would then make a passkey, paste
`/knos address <address>` as a comment on the pull request and press Comment: 4 clicks, no repository. That is a
program upgrade (multisig, public 8-day delay) and has not been built.
