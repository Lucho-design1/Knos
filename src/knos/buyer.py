"""Post a task as a buyer: one command from a written spec and a folder of hidden tests to an issue, a seal and the
exact funding command (`knos task post`, docs/START.md).

What a buyer needs before work starts, in order, and which existing piece does each:

    1. the spec           a Markdown file; it becomes the issue's description (public: the worker reads only this)
    2. the hidden tests   a folder kept OUTSIDE every repository; `knos accept init` makes a black-box one from a
                          reference program. Its hash is sealed, its content is never posted
    3. the seal           knos.referee.seal: the bundle's hash and the hash of the judging code that will judge it,
                          posted on the issue as a comment, so anyone can later check the tests that judged were these
    4. the money          `knos fund-wallet OWNER/REPO#N AMOUNT ...` (this command prints it; it never moves money
                          itself), with the fee the program takes at payout said before anyone funds
    5. the referee        `knos referee works --seal ... --hidden ...` once work is delivered

Nothing is sent without `send=True` (`--send`): then `gh` opens the issue (unless one is named) and posts the seal
comment, as the buyer's own GitHub account. The plan is returned either way, so a buyer sees every step first.
