"""The first 63 entries of the cheat library: the tamper benchmark's attacks on the slugify sample repository, 21 per
language (Python/pytest, JavaScript/node:test, Ruby/minitest), as docs/reference/TAMPER.md reports them.

Each case is real: it names the function in tests/bench_tamper/<module> that builds the cheating pull request from the
sample's base, and the rule of this library that must refuse it (`expect`). tests/test_referee_cheats.py builds every
case and checks that the rule fires and the referee refuses it; the six cases no path or text rule can see in
principle (a no-op claim, constants for the visible examples, forgery from inside the process) are ALSO judged end to
end by the sealed black-box tests in tests/test_referee_works.py.
