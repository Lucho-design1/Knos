"""Where a reproduction's result goes, and the "Reproduced by Knos" badge.

Every result is first written to the PRIVATE folder (<out>/private/<digest>/): the result, the run logs and, when it
is not reproduced, a notice for the authors. Only `publish` writes to <out>/public/, and it refuses every result that
is not `reproduced` with every claim holding, no cheat rule fired and a digest that checks. A contested result goes
to its authors privately first; Knos never publishes it. There is no flag that changes this.

The badge is drawn with knos.badge's drawing (the same mark, size and fonts as "paid on proof" and "Knos-verified"),
from a result that checks and from nothing else. The result page has one section per claim; the funding link a spec
names appears there and only there, and only on a reproduced result.
