"""`knos record verify`: hold a Knos Record to itself, to Solana and to Sibyl's memory.

    1. the file    every line parses, has the record's fields, is line n at seq n, links to the hash before it, hashes
                   to what it says, has the tier its kind names, and holds nothing a public record may not
    2. anchors     each anchor covers the lines right after the last one; the Merkle root of those lines, recomputed
                   here, is the root it states, and its head is the hash of its last line
    3. the chain   each anchor's transaction exists on the cluster, succeeded, was signed by the wallet the line names,
                   and its Memo instruction is exactly the memo recomputed in 2 (skipped with offline=True: then the
                   report says the chain was not read)
    4. Sibyl       when Sibyl's store is beside the file (or one is given), every line in Sibyl's journal (COLD) is in
                   the file with the same hash and every line of the file is in Sibyl's journal; each claim's entity
                   (WARM) and each paper's reference (REFERENCE) points at its latest line. Lines removed from the end
                   of the file, which break no hash, are caught here, and by the next anchor's `first`.

A public copy of the file has no Sibyl store beside it; it is then checked by 1-3 and the report says Sibyl was not
consulted. Lines after the last anchor are reported as unanchored: nothing on chain vouches for them yet.
