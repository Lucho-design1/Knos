"""A referee verdict, off chain: the message m of n re-runners sign, and the rule that releases or refunds on it.

This is the off-chain mirror of knos_pay 0.3.34's referee-panel path (programs-v2/knos_pay/src/order_proof.rs):

    on chain                                  here
    the order's address                       job
    the order's terms + the evidence hash     evidence_hash
    PayOrderVerdict / RefundOrderVerdict      verdict "PASS" -> outcome "release" / "FAIL" -> outcome "refund"
    the order's amount, the payee's address   amount, recipient
    the order's deadline                      expiry (after it RefundOrder refunds with no signature)
    the order's funding stamp                 nonce (a verdict for one funding pays no later funding)
    the panel pinned at funding (m of n)      keys, m
    the ed25519 precompile, distinct keys     check(): distinct registered keys with a valid signature

The program signs over its own 32-byte digest (knos.proof.issuers.verdict_digest); this module's message is the
same facts in a fixed layout a re-runner can read before signing. Nothing here holds a key.

Layout (139 bytes): b"knos-verdict-v1" | job 32 | evidence_hash 32 | "PASS" or "FAIL" | amount u64 LE | recipient 32 |
expiry i64 LE | nonce u64 LE.
