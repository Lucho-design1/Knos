"""How long a transaction's blockhash stays good, measured on the cluster rather than assumed.

A transaction names a recent blockhash and is refused once the cluster's block height passes the `lastValidBlockHeight`
that getLatestBlockhash gave with it: "the most recent 151 stored hashes" (https://solana.com/docs/advanced/confirmation).
That window is counted in blocks, so its length in seconds follows the slot time. SIMD-0525 (200 ms slots, active on
devnet at slot 487,296,000) left the count unchanged and so shortened the wall-clock window
(proposals/0525-reduce-slot-times.md: "any user-facing ... behavior measured in number of slots may become shorter in
wall-clock time").

Measured on devnet on 14 Oct 2026 at 19:59 UTC (v0329/agents/V34CAP/bh-measure.txt): lastValidBlockHeight minus the
`confirmed` block height was 134 to 146 blocks (mean 143) while the block height rose 232 blocks in 54.0 s (4.297 a
second; getRecentPerformanceSamples: 236 to 240 ms a slot), so a blockhash fetched at `confirmed` had about 33 s left.
Docs that said "about a minute" (ADVANCE.md) or "60 to 90 seconds" were written for 400 ms slots.

What follows from it in Knos: a transaction two parties sign on two machines, or one an approver signs later, does not
wait on a blockhash at all: it uses a durable nonce (knos.platform.nonce). `life` measures the window again whenever a
number is wanted; `expired` is the cluster's own answer for one blockhash.
