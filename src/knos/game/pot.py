"""The game's pot: funders pool money across all attempts, and the referee's final verdicts divide it.

    rule(cfg)                   the division rule from config/fees.yaml (game_pot: the winner's share and the
                                partial-credit share, at most `max_paid` payees: one knos_pay order pays 1 to 4)
    split(final, cfg)           who receives which basis points of every pot order, from the verdicts: the winner gets
                                winner_bps; the partial share goes to the other passing attempts in proportion to their
                                lift (rank order, at most max_paid - 1 of them); the winner alone takes it all when
                                nobody else passed; nobody passed: no split (every order is refunded after its deadline)
    plan(game_id, spec_hash, repo_id, cfg)   the pot's private knos_pay scope, terms and options (no repository, no
                                issue on chain; the salt sha256("knos-game:" + game id) is public, so anyone finds a pot)
    fund_ix(p, funder, token, mint, amount)  the unsigned FundOrderWallet one funder's wallet signs: amount + payout fee
    state(ledger, p, mint)      the pot as the chain has it (only orders on the pot's own terms and mint are counted)
    pay_litesvm(root, p, pledges, payees)    the payout leg replayed in LiteSVM (LABEL): knos_pay pays an order only on
                                a pay token from its judge (a GitHub-signed run of the pinned prove.yml, or the m-of-n
                                referee verdict path when it lands); a game judged by Knos has no GitHub run, so the
                                same orders are funded and paid in the program's test build, exactly as it divides them

Fees: the payout fee (live, knos_pay) is on top of each order, paid by the funder; the Knos bounty fee
(fees.bounty_platform, decided) applies to the pot, its on-chain part being that payout fee and the rest invoiced off
chain. Amounts are base units of a 6-decimal mint; on devnet all of it is test money.
