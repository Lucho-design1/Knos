"""Referee changes need the founder. A change to the judge, the cheat library or the runner never comes in as an agent's
pull request (those paths are core: refused). It comes as the founder's own pull request, and before it may judge:

    1. red-team gate   the fixed red-team set (knos.cheats.CASES, built by MAIN's code from tests/bench_tamper) is run
                       through main's scanner and through the candidate's, each in its own process from its own tree.
                       The candidate must refuse at least as many cases as main AND every case main refuses
                       (`at_least_current`). A weaker referee is blocked here, whoever signed it.
    2. shadow          the candidate referee re-scores past jobs of the loop (their diffs, from the run folder) beside
                       main's referee; every disagreement is listed. Fewer than shadow_jobs_min jobs: it waits.
    3. founder         an ed25519 signature over "knos-self:referee:<candidate loop_hash>" by a key in
                       targets.yml loop.referee_change.approval_keys. No key listed: the change waits for the founder.
