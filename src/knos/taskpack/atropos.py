"""Task packages as rows for a training environment (Hermes Atropos BaseEnv, owned by AGENTS: hermes/atropos/) and as
a sealed spec for the referee (knos.referee). A row carries only what the solver may see: the statement, the
repository and base commit, the scope, and the hashes that bind the hidden tests. The reward comes from `score`,
which grades a candidate patch against the sealed tests (knos.taskpack.grade) on the grader's side: a row holds no path to
the package, so a solver given the rows cannot open the hidden tests. Grading runs the candidate's code unsandboxed
(see knos.taskpack.grade): run the grader in a disposable container. Devnet / demo use only.
